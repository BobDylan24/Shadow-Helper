# Shadow Helper
 Shadow Helper, the multipurpose discord bot.


# How to install
It is not recomended to self host the Shadow Helper discord bot as it is not always up to date.\
I recomend you use the bot hosted by me as it is up to date.

Once Python is installed you need to clone the repository by click code then download as zip.\
\
Open up the zip file and extract the files into a folder.\
